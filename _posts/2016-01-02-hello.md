Hello, 

Good to see you here. I'm not really sure how did you find your way to this link, but I'm really glad you did. I'm Manish Ahuja, and [CogentDesi ][0]is an online alias, that I've given myself. 

The idea of this website is still being contemplated upon. Consider this as a start with a lot of ideas, but not a solid structure. The plan of action is to begin somewhere, put some time, work and effort into this and see how all the pieces fall in their place to form an all inclusive canvas of my thoughts in form of posts.

This site is being hosted on [The Grid][1], and considering it's the newest kid on the block of web hosting, I'm still trying to figure things out around here. New to hosting, new to writing posts in a website, where all the content is exclusively mine (unless mentioned otherwise), and hopefully a regular torrent of new readers and an army of regular ones. \*fingers crossed\* 

So, hang on tight and fasten your seat-belts. I'm excited and nervous about this journey. Hope to see you make a visit every time I've something new to share. 
Looking forward to your thoughts on what you see/ read in this space. 

Let's get this conversation started, shall we?
